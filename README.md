Collection of Basic and essentials RTL Design and verification codes.
The Design modules will be implemented in all possible modelling styles of verilog.
I have used Modelsim software & EDA Playground for RTL Simulation.



The DUT and TESTBENCH Modules are coded under a single.v file.

[DAY1]: Asynchronous Counters.

[DAY2]: Bidirectional Shift Register.
