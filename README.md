#100DAYSOFRTL  
Collection of Basic and essentials RTL Design and verification codes.
The Design modules will be implemented in all possible modelling styles of verilog.
I have used Modelsim software & EDA Playground for RTL Simulation.



The DUT and TESTBENCH Modules are coded under a single.v file.

[DAY 1]: Asynchronous Counters.

[DAY 2]: Bidirectional Shift Register.

[DAY 3]: Johnson Counter.

[DAY 4]: BCD TO Seven Segment Display Controller.

[DAY 5]: D FLIPFLOP.

[DAY 6]: ONE HOT TO BINARY ENCODER.

[DAY 7]: Binary Gray Converters.

[Day 8]: Synchronous Counter(Ringcounter).

[Day 9]:  Full Adder.

[Day 10]: Mealey Sequence Detector.

[Day 11]: Decoder Combinatinal Circuit.

[Day 12]: Fulladder cum Sub.

[Day 13]: N bit Counters.

[Day 14]: Clock Divide by even number.

[Day 15]: Demux.

[Day 16]: Parity Generators.

[Day 17]: Moore Sequence Detector.

[DAY 18]:Multiplexer.

[DAY 19]:Serial in Serial out Shift Register.

[Day 20]: Parallel oin Serial Out Shift Register.

[Day 21]: D-Latcch.
