Collection of Basic and essentials RTL Design and verification codes.
The Design modules will be implemented in all possible modelling styles of verilog.
I have used Modelsim software & EDA Playground for RTL Simulation.



The DUT and TESTBENCH Modules are coded under a single.v file.

[DAY1]: Asynchronous Counters.

[DAY2]: Bidirectional Shift Register.

[DAY3]: Johnson Counter.

[DAY4]: BCD TO Seven Segment Display Controller.

[DAY5]:D FLIPFLOP.

[DAY6]:ONE HOT TO BINARY ENCODER.

[DAY7]: Binary Gray Converters.

[DAY8]:Ringcounter.

[Day9]: Full Adder.

[Day10]: Mealey Sequence Detector.

[DAY 11]:DECODER
